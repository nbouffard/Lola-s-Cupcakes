                <p class="bio">Welcome everyone to my page! My name is Gloria but my beloved grandchildren call me <em>Lola!</em>
                For so many years it has been my dream to bring people joy in the form of cupcakes. I am a passionate 
                self taught baker living in the heart of London. I have two wonderful daughters and am blessed with three
                granddaughters. For what feels like many eons ago, I was in a traditional 9-5 job <em>living to work</em> until 
                my health had other plans. Since then I have found my life's true passion.... you guessed it <strong>cupcakes!</strong>
